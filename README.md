# Fe-GAP22

Fe-GAP22 is a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) by extending a DFT database for ferromagnetic bcc iron (https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2017.0006/v2) to include highly distorted primitive bcc cells and surface separation, along with small crack-tip configurations that are identified by means of a fully automated active learning workflow.
